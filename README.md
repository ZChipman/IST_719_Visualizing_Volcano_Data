# Visualizing_Volcano_Data:

## Background:

Utilized various data visualization techniques to create a poster on a dataset detailing volcanic eruptions using R and Adobe Illustrator. This poster was the final project for the Data Visualization course at Syracuse University. The goal of the poster was to answer three questions:

1. Where are the volcanoes located?

2. In what geological conditions do these eruptions occur?

3. When did the latest eruptions for these volcanoes occur?

## Files:
Volcanic_Eruptions_in_the_Holocene_Period.pdf: Final Poster that was presented during poster session.

Volcanic_Eruptions_Code.R: R code used to make plots shown in the poster. These plots will vary slightly to the ones in the final poster as some aesthetic edits were made in Adobe illustrator. R-studio will be required to view this file.

Volcano_Eruptions.csv: Kaggle data used to create the figures featured in the poster.
